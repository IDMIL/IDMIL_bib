Twenty participants completed a simple rotation task on a interactive surface with four different input techniques (two tangibles and two virtual touch widgets) in the three output conditions, representing the distance from the locus of attention. We found that users were in average 20\% faster using tangible knobs than using the virtual knobs. We found that tangible knobs retains performance even if they are not in the locus of attention of the users. We provide four recommendations of suit- able choosing knobs based on tasks and design constraints.},

The stimuli were designed as a combination of the most relevant perceptual parameters of force feedback; acceleration, friction, detent amplitude and spacing. The results indicate that there is a relationship between the shape of a knob and its haptic feedback. The perceived functionality can be dynamically altered by changing its shape and haptic feedback. This work serves as basis for the design of dynamic interface controls that can adapt their shape and haptic feel to the content that is controlled. In our demonstration, we show the six distinct knobs shapes with the different haptic feedback stimuli. Attendees can experience the interaction with the different knob shapes in relation the stimuli and design stimuli with a graphical editor.},

The language is based on a simple and well defined formal semantics. A {FAUST} program denotes a signal processor, a mathematical function that transforms input signals into output signals. Being able to know precisely what a program computes is important not only for programmers, but also for compilers needing to generate the best possible code. Moreover these semantics questions are crucial for the long term preservation of music programs. The following paragraphs will give an overview of the language as well as a description of the compiler, including the generation of parallel code.},

We embedded inside {TorqueTuner} a collection of haptic eﬀects (Wall, Magnet, Detents, Spring, Friction, Spin, Free) and a bi-directional interface through libmapper, a software library for making connections between data signals on a shared network. To increase aﬀordability and portability of force-feedback implementations in {DMI} design, we designed our platform to be wireless, self-contained and built from commercially available components. To provide examples of modularity and portability, we integrated {TorqueTuner} into a standalone haptic knob and into an existing {DMI}, the T-Stick. We implemented 3 musical applications (Pitch wheel, Turntable and Exciter), by mapping sensors to sound synthesis in audio programming environment {SuperCollider}. While the original goal was to simulate the haptic feedback associated with turning a knob, we found that the platform allows for further expanding interaction possibilities in application scenarios where rotary control is familiar.},

Haptic experience design, which is woven together with other multisensory design efforts, interfaces is now becoming part of many designers' jobs. We can expect it to present unique challenges, and yet we know almost nothing of what it looks like “in the wild” due to the field's relative youth, its technical complexity, the multisensory interactions between haptics, sight, and sound, and the difficulty of accessing practitioners in professional and proprietary environments. In this paper, we analyze interviews with six professional haptic designers to document and articulate haptic experience design by observing designers' goals and processes and finding themes at three levels of scope: the multisensory nature of haptic experiences, a map of the collaborative ecosystem, and the cultural context of haptics. Our findings are augmented by feedback obtained in a recent design workshop at an international haptics conference. We find that haptic designers follow a familiar design process, but face specific challenges when working with haptics. We capture and summarize these challenges, make concrete recommendations to conquer them, and present a vision for the future of haptic experience design.},

We qualitatively characterized participants’ design processes and observed two basic example uses: as a starting point or template for a design task, and as a learning method. We discuss how features supporting internal visibility and composition inﬂuenced these example uses, and articulate several implications for {VT} editing tools and libraries of {VT} examples.

The first study compared visual feedback, force feedback, and a combination of force feedback and shape change. Results indicate that force feedback correlates to experienced dominance during interaction, while shape change mainly affects experienced arousal. The second study explored how force feedback and shape change could communicate affective meaning during interaction with the thermostat through a co-design study. Participants designed the thermostat behavior for three scenarios supporting energy savings. Results suggest that despite their abstractness, force feedback and shape change convey affective meaning during the user-system dialogue. The findings contribute to the design of intelligible and intuitive feedback.},

Today there is a trade-off present in the state of the art for music-related networking. At one extreme, we have many systems still using {MIDI}, an old and insufficient standard for specifying keyboard-oriented commands embedded in short, coded 3-byte messages, limiting modulation controls to a 7-bit range. At the other extreme we have Open Sound Control ({OSC}) [7], a flexible packet format that supports named data and a wide number of binary numerical representations, but lacks built-in semantic standards. The present work proposes a semantic layer built on {OSC} over multicast {UDP}/{IP} used to carry metadata about signals, which can specify peer-to-peer connectivity between nodes along with instructions for associated translation of data representations. The translation layer avoids the need for normalization or standardization of data representation while maintaining ease of use and providing a distributed, flexible approach to music networking. The goal is to provide a system for fast and dynamic experimentation during the mapping phase of instrument design.},

	abstract = {The {FireFader} is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized for introducing musicians to haptics. It is based upon a single-degree-of-freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a {DC} motor, also known as a “motorized fader.” A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The {FireFader} consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the {FireFader} allows it to be linked to a computer via {USB} so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over {USB} increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the {FireFader} design are presented.},

From the analysis, data are presented that comprehensively quantify the effects of feedback in haptic interactions with {DMI} devices. The investigation revealed that the various types of haptic feedback applied had no significant functional effect upon device performance in pitch selection tasks; however, a number of significant effects were found upon the users’ perception of usability and their experiences with each of the different feedback types.},

	abstract = {Digital Music Instruments ({DMI}) are usually composed of a gestural controller connected to a general-purpose computer. Recent developments in embedded computing facilitate new self-contained designs, where gestural interface and processing unit are integrated. These new instruments are possibly more focused on the musical activity, while maintaining many of the technical and creative capabilities of computer systems. In this context we have developed Prynth, a framework for rapid development that addresses important technical and usability features to support self-contained instruments. We also present “The Mitt”, an instrument with a tangible interface that captures high-resolution finger gestures and a first test of an implementation using the Prynth framework.},

It generalizes and extends the concept of a virtual coupling network, an artificial link between the haptic display and a virtual world, to include both the impedance and admittance models of haptic interaction. A benchmark example exposes an important duality between these two cases. Linear circuit theory is used to develop necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of a haptic simulation, assuming the human operator and virtual environment are passive. These equations lead to an explicit design procedure for virtual coupling networks which give maximum performance while guaranteeing stability. By decoupling the haptic display control problem from the design of virtual environments, the use of a virtual coupling network frees the developer of haptic-enabled virtual reality models from issues of mechanical stability.},

At the low end, the range is typically limited by inherent dynamics of the interface device, such as inertia and friction. At the high end, the range is typically limited by system stability. In a number of the applications, the principal limitation has proven to be the achievable upper limit on impedance. Therefore, a benchmark problem of considerable importance is the implementation of a stiff "wall". Contacting a wall may be described as the reversible transition from a region of very low impedance to one of very high impedance. A theoretical analysis (supplemented with discussion of experimental and simulation results) of stiff wall implementation is presented. The main result is a criterion for the passivity of a virtual wall in terms of two nondimensional parameters.},

	abstract = {Experiments and simulations of a single-axis force-reflecting teleoperation system have been conducted to investigate the problem of contacting a hard environment and maintaining a controlled force in teleoperation in which position is fed forward from the hand controller (master) to the manipulator (slave), and force is fed back to the human operator through motors in the master. The simulations, using an electrical circuit model, reproduce the behavior of the real system, including effects of human operator biomechanics. It is shown that human operator properties, which vary as a result of different types of grasp of the handle, affect the stability of the system in the hard-contact task. The effect of a heavier grasp on the handle is equivalent to increased hand-controlled velocity damping in terms of the systems stability in the contact task, but control system damping sufficient to guarantee stable contact results in perceptible sluggishness of the control handle's response in free motion. These results suggest that human operator biomechanics must be taken into account to guarantee stable and ergonomic performance of advanced teleoperators.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The "Z-Width" of a haptic display is the dynamic range of impedances that can be passively rendered. Haptic displays with larger Z-width generally render more realistic feeling virtual environments. We present a new method for measuring and displaying the Z- width of a haptic display. Instead of stiffness-damping plots, we believe a more illustrative technique for plotting the Z-width of a haptic interface is the envelope of achievable passive impedances as a function of frequency. Both hardware and analysis software for this new type of Z-width measurement are discussed. As previous research has shown, the maximum passive impedance that a device can render is directly related to the physical damping available in the mechanism. In an effort to maximize the Z-width of the haptic display, we present a new technique for adding physical damping to a haptic display through the use of analog electronics in the motor amplifier. Due to its electrical nature, active electrical damping has the benefit of dynamically variable parameters with no added mechanical complexity or mass. With the addition of active electrical damping, we show a performance improvement via a larger Z-width and larger range of passive virtual environment parameters.},

Performance Metrics for Haptic Interfaces aims at meeting this need by establishing standard practices for the evaluation of haptic interfaces and by identifying significant performance metrics.Towards this end, a combined physical and psychophysical experimental methodology is presented. Firstly, existing physical performance measures and device characterization techniques are investigated and described in an illustrative way. Secondly, a wide range of human psychophysical experiments are reviewed and the appropriate ones are applied to haptic interactions. The psychophysical experiments are unified as a systematic and complete evaluation method for haptic interfaces. Finally, synthesis of both evaluation methods is discussed.The metrics provided in this state-of-the-art volume will guide readers in evaluating the performance of any haptic interface. The generic methodology will enable researchers to experimentally assess the suitability of a haptic interface for a specific purpose, to characterize and compare devices quantitatively and to identify possible improvement strategies in the design of a system.},

	abstract = {Smooth motion is critical to some robotic applications such as haptics or those requiring high precision force control. These systems are often direct-drive, so any torque ripple in the motor output must be minimal. Unfortunately, low inherent torque ripple motors are expensive. Low cost brushless {DC} motors are becoming more prevalent, especially from the hobby {RC} community. These motors often have the required high torque density; however, they also have signiﬁcant torque ripple. This paper presents a system that is low cost using a method for anticogging - the compensation of cogging torque in low cost, high torque motors. While other methods exist to compensate for current-based torque ripple (mutual or reluctance torque), none have addressed cogging torque, except by adding expensive force sensors. This paper presents two methods that use a position sensor (already present for servo motors) to map cogging torque to rotor position. The map is played back according to position reported from the sensor to cancel the cogging torque. The design and testing of a low cost haptic arm using anticogging shows validation; however, the approach is much broader, and can be applied to any precision force application. Test results on eleven different motors show an average removal of 69 \% of torque ripple with no added cost in robotic servo applications.},

	abstract = {The hybrid stepping motor is promising as a high-torque and low-speed servomotor, since the motor can be considered as a multipole synchronous motor. For this application, it is necessary to have a clear equivalent circuit under the sinusoidal current drive just like the conventional brushless {DC} motor. For the given stator/rotor teeth and winding arrangements of the hybrid stepping motor, the permeance distribution with respect to the rotor position is obtained by a well-known permeance-based method. Based on the calculated permeance distribution, an equivalent magnetic circuit of the given motor can be obtained, from which the basic voltage equation can be deduced. Following this procedure, electric parameters in the voltage equation are related to the machine construction constants such as stator-rotor pole dimensions, air-gap length, number of turns of the stator windings, and magnetomotive force ({MMF}) of the permanent magnet. The analysis shows that a fundamental component of the permeance distribution produces the average torque and that harmonic components produce the ripple torque under the sinusoidal current drives. The cogging torque is also produced by the 4th harmonic component of the permeance distribution. For the laboratory testing, the two-phase hybrid stepping motor connected to the current-controlled voltage source inverter was used. The experimental results showed quite reasonable agreement with the predicted instantaneous torque.},

	abstract = {Haptics, and specifically vibrotactile-augmented interfaces, have been the object of much research in the music technology domain: In the last few decades, many musical haptic interfaces have been designed and used to teach, perform, and compose music. The investigation of the design of meaningful ways to convey musical information via the sense of touch is a paramount step toward achieving truly transparent haptic-augmented interfaces for music performance and practice, and in this chapter we present our recent work in this context. We start by defining a model for haptic-augmented interfaces for music, and a taxonomy of vibrotactile feedback and stimulation, which we use to categorize a brief literature review on the topic. We then present the design and evaluation of a haptic language of cues in the form of tactile icons delivered via vibrotactile-equipped wearable garments. This language constitutes the base of a “wearable score” used in music performance and practice. We provide design guidelines for our tactile icons and user-based evaluations to assess their effectiveness in delivering musical information and report on the system’s implementation in a live musical performance.},

The overall end-to-end latency and bandwidth are measured as the basic performance metrics of interest. The results show that a maximum message rate of 2300Hz is possible on a 2.4GHz network for a single embedded device and decreases as the number of devices are added. During testing it was possible to have up to 7 wireless devices transmitting at 100Hz to a wireless receiver via a router while attaining less than 10ms of end-to-end latency. Performance however degrades with increasing sending rates and number of devices. Additionally, performance can also vary significantly from day to day depending on network usage in a crowded environment.},

	abstract = {New representations of thought -- written language, mathematical notation, information graphics, etc -- have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity's collectively-thinkable territory. But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard. Like any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But less obviously, and more importantly, it is enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned. We are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought. But the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities -- all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding -- instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest. This talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.},

The main technological item introduced here is the haptic interface itself (nicknamed the “Pantograph”) which measures position and velocity of a manipulated knob and displays forces in two dimensions over a wide frequency range. Programmed mechanical models are used to kinesthetically describe the features of the interface. These models are analogous to iconic representations in conventional graphic interfaces. Users, acting and perceiving through the haptic channel, simultaneously perceive simulated objects through the visual and auditory channels. Further developments are briefly reported.},

However, these input devices cannot provide sufficient intuitive interface to move the game paddle or provide multi-modal feedback for the user. We developed a haptic game device that gives the user haptic feedback during the game as well as visual and sound feedback. The user can move the position of the paddle by spinning the dial knob and feels various multi-modal effects according to the game context. Basic haptic effects include detent, vibration, friction and barrier. We can generate any combinations of these effects by adjusting the amount, frequency, and direction of torque along the rotational path. The result of a user-study showed that the proposed haptic dial interface made a simple brickout game more fun and more interesting. Additionally, the users were able to focus on the game more easily than when they played using a mouse.},

From a computer science perspective, {IoMusT} refers to the networks of computing devices embedded in physical objects (musical things) dedicated to the production and/or reception of musical content. Musical things, such as smart musical instruments or wearables, are connected by an infrastructure that enables multidirectional communication, both locally and remotely. We present a vision in which the {IoMusT} enables the connection of digital and physical domains by means of appropriate information and communication technologies, fostering novel musical applications and services. The ecosystems associated with the {IoMusT} include interoperable devices and services that connect musicians and audiences to support musician-musician, audience-musicians, and audience-audience interactions. In this paper, we first propose a vision for the {IoMusT} and its motivations. We then discuss five scenarios illustrating how the {IoMusT} could support: 1) augmented and immersive concert experiences; 2) audience participation; 3) remote rehearsals; 4) music e-learning; and 5) smart studio production. We identify key capabilities missing from today's systems and discuss the research needed to develop these capabilities across a set of interdisciplinary challenges. These encompass network communication (e.g., ultra-low latency and security), music information research (e.g., artificial intelligence for real-time audio content description and multimodal sensing), music interaction (e.g., distributed performance and music e-learning), as well as legal and responsible innovation aspects to ensure that future {IoMusT} services are socially desirable and undertaken in the public interest.},

A new musical instrument is physically intuitive if the physics of haptic interaction are similar to those supported by a traditional musical instrument. We suggest that physically intuitive new musical instruments may help performers transfer motor skills from familiar, traditional musical instruments. Both actively controlled acoustic instruments and many haptic instruments are physically intuitive. We design a physically intuitive haptic drumstick. Simple models of drumstick dynamics and drumstick/membrane collisions are explained and implemented on a high-resolution haptic device. Next, we create a new musical instrument by altering the haptic drumstick dynamics in a physically intuitive manner. We focus on drum rolls. In particular, we alter the haptic drumstick dynamics to assist performers in playing singlehanded drum rolls. Finally, we analyze the stability of the altered system dynamics using a Poincare map.},

The keyboard includes an electromechanical key actuation and sensing element that in combination with electronic processing allows the performer to adjust both tactile and tone control parameters associated with keyboard touch response. The tactile response can be tuned over a broad range and is capable of simulating a light organ touch, heavier "piano key feel" or stiff percussive action. Since any of these features can be selected and adjusted while the performer is playing the keyboard, the keyboard system also has a desirable "real time" capability that does not interfere with musical performance.},

	abstract = {Current input device taxonomies and other frameworks typically emphasize the mechanical structure of input devices. We suggest that selecting an appropriate input device for an interactive task requires looking beyond the physical structure of devices to the deeper perceptual structure of the task, the device, and the interrelationship between the perceptual structure of the task and the control properties of the device. We affirm that perception is key to understanding performance of multidimensional input devices on multidimensional tasks. We have therefore extended the theory of processing of percetual structure to graphical interactive tasks and to the control structure of input devices. This allows us to predict task and device combinations that lead to better performance and hypothesize that performance is improved when the perceptual structure of the task matches the control structure of the device. We conducted an experiment in which subjects performed two tasks with different perceptual structures, using two input devices with correspondingly different control structures, a three-dimensional tracker and a mouse. We analyzed both speed and accuracy, as well as the trajectories generated by subjects as they used the unconstrained three-dimensional tracker to perform each task. The result support our hypothesis and confirm the importance of matching the perceptual structure of the task and the control structure of the input device.},

We report on an investigation of the use of touch as a way of reducing visual overload in the conventional desktop. In a two-phase study, we investigated the use of the {PHANToM} haptic device as a means of interacting with a conventional graphical user interface. The first experiment compared the effects of four different haptic augmentations on usability in a simple targeting task. The second experiment involved a more ecologically-oriented searching and scrolling task. Results indicated that the haptic effects did not improve users performance in terms of task completion time. However, the number of errors made was significantly reduced. Subjective workload measures showed that participants perceived many aspects of workload as significantly less with haptics. The results are described and the implications for the use of haptics in user interface design are discussed.},

The violin, one of the most refined and expressive of traditional instruments, combines,a peculiar physical interface with a rich acoustic diffuser. We have built a new instrument that includes elements of both the violin's physical performance,interface and its spatial filtering audio diffuser, yet eliminates both the resonating body and the strings. The instrument, {BoSSA} (Bowed-Sensor-Speaker-Array), is an amalgamation and extension of our previous work with violin interfaces, physical models, and directional tonal radiation studies. In addition to describing the various physical and software elements that make up {BoSSA}, we discuss some of its musical features and potentials; we are particularly impressed by the sense of presenceand intimacyit provides, and by its potential for creating a new kind of electronic chamber,music. 1.0 Introduction Traditional musical,instruments provide compel-},

By leveraging the Faust {DSP} programming environment, an output Pd, Max/{MSP}, {SuperCollider}, {VST}, {LADSPA}, or other external module is created, allowing the artist to hear the sound of the physical model in real time using an audio host application. To show how the compiler works, the example model “touch a resonator” is presented.},

These boundaries are independent of the haptic device's mass and the sampling time. Furthermore, the dependency of the maximum stable virtual stiffness is discussed. Moreover, this paper illustrates that the passive region which is defined by Colgate's passivity condition is a subset inside the stable region for undelayed systems, but not for delayed systems},

It challenges the assumption that an electronic instrument consists solely of an interface and a sound generator. It emphasises the importance of the mapping between input parameters and sound parameters, and suggests that this can define the very essence of an instrument. The terms involved with mapping are defined, and existing literature reviewed and summarised. A model for understanding the design of such mapping strategies for electronic instruments is put forward, along with a roadmap of ongoing research focussing on the testing and evaluation of such mapping strategies.},

However, interaction designers are rarely engineers, and 30 years of haptic inventions are buried in a fragmented literature that describes devices mechanically rather than by potential purpose. We conceived of Haptipedia to unlock this trove of examples: Haptipedia presents a device corpus for exploration through metadata that matter to both device and interaction designers. It is a taxonomy of device attributes that go beyond physical description to capture potential utility, applied to a growing database of 105 grounded force-feedback devices, and accessed through a public visualization that links utility to morphology. Haptipedia's design was driven by both systematic review of the haptic device literature and rich input from diverse haptic designers. We describe Haptipedia's reception (including hopes it will redefine device reporting standards) and our plans for its sustainability through community participation.},

At The University of Michigan, a traditional undergraduate mechanical engineering course in systems dynamics and a new undergraduate electrical engineering course in embedded control systems have been equipped with instructional modules based on two new single-axis haptic interface devices. The {iTouch} motor is a low-budget, single axis, voice-coil based haptic device intended for teaching system dynamics fundamentals. Students gain hands-on experience by assembling these motors from scratch, performing experiments, and comparing actual to theoretically predicted dynamic response. A second device called "The Box" features higher torque output and robustness for the embedded control systems course. Both device designs are presented and contrasted and results following from their introduction into the curriculum are discussed. The uses of these devices to rapidly prototype various research projects and integrate undergraduate students into a research program are also briefly discussed.},
